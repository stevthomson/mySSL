MySSL is a variation of the SSL handshake and data transfer phase

To run the handshake and data transfer, open two terminals and change directories to be where client.py and server.py reside

in one terminal execute the command:

python3 server.py

then in the other:

python3 client.py

The handshake, key exchange, and file exchange will happen automatically and any errors that occur should be reported without crashing the program

The server will transfer the file tortoise_hare.txt from serverfiles to clientfiles
